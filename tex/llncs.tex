			%This whitepaper addresses the detected gap by introducing the self-sovereign personal data platform Procivis idNet, thereby answering the question of how to develop a blockchain-based and e-ID agnostic platform that enables self-sovereign market trading of personal data? In order to answer this question with a separation of concerns, we pose the following sub-questions: What are the critical requirements and the corresponding architecture of Procivis' self-sovereign personal data platform? What are the optimized user on-boarding processes and reliable price discovery mechanisms? What are the system-engagement processes for the stakeholders?

			The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{s:section-2} introduces supplementary literature and related work. Section~\ref{s:section-3} then outlines the vision of Chorus Technology as well as different use-cases. Afterwards, Section~\ref{s:section-4} analyses the requirements of the our system and outlines the resulting system architecture that we derive from the requirements. Afterwards, Section~\ref{s:section-5} expands on the system-engagement processes for the stakeholders, followed by Section~\ref{s:section-6} that introduces the Chorus prototype as well as feasibility evaluation. Section~\ref{s:section-7} provides an discussion and an analysis of related projects. Finally, Section~\ref{s:section-8} concludes this work and provides an outlook on future work.

	\section{Technical Background and Related Works}	
		\label{s:section-2}
		
		The following section provides background information and describes related works regarding previous ideas and concepts that focus on a blockchain-based VANET platforms. First, Section~\ref{ss:blockchain-intro} introduces the general concepts of blockchain technology, terms and frameworks. Afterwards, Section~\ref{ss:autonomous-vehicles} and Section~\ref{ss:vanets} focus on the fundamentals of autonomous vehicles as well as vehicular ad-hoc networks. Finally, Section~\ref{ss:related-work} focuses on related work.

		\subsection{Blockchain Technology}
			\label{ss:blockchain-intro}
			
			\textbf{Work-In-Progress}				
			
			maybe already cite unchained and whisperkey paper?			
		
%			A blockchain consists of a chronologically ordered chain of blocks, where every block consists of a certain number of validated transactions. Each block links to its predecessor by a hash reference, so that changing the content of one block also changes all succeeding blocks and hence breaks the chain. All blocks are stored on and verified by all participating nodes. The blockchain concept is interesting for a M2M trading platform since it removes the need for trusted third party and instead enables trust-less transaction enactment and transactions that were agreed up on cannot be changed any more (tamper-proof).
%			
%			In recent years, the blockchain concept majored and spread in popularity. Besides the initial Bitcoin blockchain, several other architectures emerged, e.g., Ethereum \cite{wood2014ethereum}, Qtum \cite{qtumWhitepaper}, or Tezos \cite{tezosWhitepaper}. Those alternative blockchain platforms further provide Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer level in order to enable smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts are, ``orchestration- and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties" \cite{qtumWhitepaper}. Parties participating in the contract enactment establish binding agreements and deploy applications using such smart contracts in order to provide blockchain-based applications. Moreover, a variety of applications and use-cases for blockchains have been proposed, e.g., as a platform for IoT applications \cite{huckle2016internet}\cite{leiding2016self}, in the finance sector \cite{nguyen2016blockchain}\cite{tetherWhitepaper}, for reputation systems \cite{SemadaWhitepaper}, as part of security and authentication protocols \cite{AuthcoinLeiding2016MCIS}\cite{mccorry2015authenticated}\cite{ouaddah2017towards} or privacy solutions \cite{dorri2017blockchain}.

			\label{ss:related-work}

			\textbf{Work-In-Progress}

			
%			Several other academic as well as non-academic projects experimented with ideas and prototypes of blockchain-based trading platforms that enable the M2M economy. In \cite{leiding2016self}, the authors describe a blockchain solution for a variety of services within vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), e.g., traffic management, toll payment systems, traffic regulation enforcement and more. In 2018, the automotive company got a patent for a very similar idea of traffic marshaling via a blockchain system \cite{macneille2018vehicle}. Chorus technologies \cite{chorusWhitepaper} envisioned a whole library for all types of services and transaction around the ecosystem of autonomous vehicles within VANETs. The authors of \cite{davWhitepaper} propose a solution that allows vehicles to discover, communicate and transact with one another using cryptocurrencies. 
%			\cite{oakenTeslaTollbooth} present a prototype of a blockchain-based toll road system. In 2013, Mike Hearn gave a short talk\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVyv4t0OKe4}} at the Turing Festival in Edinburgh describing several of these ideas. 
%			
%			Besides the automotive sector, the authors of \cite{sikorski2017blockchain} describe and implement a M2M electricity market for chemical industry where industrial plants are trading electricity with each other via a blockchain platform.
%			
%			The alternative blockchain solution IOTA is offering an IoT market place \cite{iotaMarketplace} for IoT devices where sensor data can be bought and sold using blockchain technology.

	\section{System Design and Architecture}
		\label{s:section-4}	

		%%RQ-1: What are the critical requirements and the corresponding architecture of the Chorus platform?

		The vision of Chorus outlined in Section \ref{s:section-3} is now analyzed from technical perspective as part of the following section. In order to identify, structure and formalize the critical requirements and stakeholders on an abstract level, we use one part of an Agent-Oriented Modeling (AOM) method \cite{sterling2009art}, i.e., goal models. Section~\ref{ss:requirement-engineering} introduces AOM goal models and the Chorus specific goal model. The produced goal model is used in subsequent Section \ref{ss:component-diagrams} to derive the Chrous system architecture . The resulting system architecture and specifications serve as implementation guidelines. Finally, Section~\ref{ss:smart-contract-lifecycle-management} provides some details on the smart contract lifecycle management within our solution, whereas Section~\ref{ss:library-api} outlines a general outlook on the APIs and how to integrate the Chorus library into external applications.

		\subsection{Functional Goals, Quality Goals, Stakeholders and Requirements}
			\label{ss:requirement-engineering}
						
			In system development and software engieerng, good requirements follow certain characteristics. According to \cite{davis1993software}\cite{ieee1994ieee} requirements address one issue only and are completely specified without missing information. Moreover, they have to be consistent and do not contradict itself, or in correlation with other requirements. Finally, a requirement must also be atomic and without conjunctions \cite{norta2014reference}.
			
			The AOM methodology is a socio-technical requirements-engineering approach used to model complex systems that consist of humans, devices, and software agents. An AOM goal model enables both, technical- and non-technical stakeholders, to capture and understand the functional- and non-functional requirements of a complex system. Figure \ref{fig:aom-notaion-elements} depicts the three main elements that an AOM goal model comprises in order to capture the system requirements and goals. Roles of involved entities are represented in form of sticky men, whereas functional requirements are depicted as parallelograms. Functional requirements are also referred to as goals. Non-functional requirements are depicted as clouds and refer to quality goals of the modeled software system. The AOM goal model follows a tree-like hierarchy with the root value proposition of the modeled system at the top. Subsequently, this main goal is decomposed into sub-goals where each sub-goal represents an aspect for achieving its parent goal \cite{marshall2014agent}. The goals are further decomposed into multi-layered sub-goals until the lowest atomic level is reached. Additionally, roles and quality goal may be assigned to goals and are inherited to lower-level goals.

		\subsection{Component Diagrams}
			\label{ss:component-diagrams}

			The abstract system- and business architecture is derived from the functional- and non-function requirements of the AOM goal model presented earlier. The services are powered by a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that is comprised of different designated components. Each of these components is self-contained, well-defined components and provides a specific set of services \cite{erl2005service}\cite{perrey2003service}. Dedicated services and components may also consist of other underlying sub-services \cite{rosen2012applied}. 
			
			In the following, a technology-agnostic UML-component-diagram representation is used to illustrate the system architecture \cite{booch1996unified}\cite{specification2007omg}. The UML notation elements used to model the architecture are presented in Figure \ref{fig:uml-component-diagram-overview}. In UML, components are represented as rectangular boxes and labeled either with the keyword \textit{component}, or with the component icon in the right-hand upper corner. A component may consists of further sub-components and is implemented by one, or more classes, or objects. Moreover, components are reusable and communicate via two types of interfaces as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:uml-component-diagram-overview}. Small squares depict ports that are attached to the border of components and expose required and provided interfaces. Ports may also specify inputs and outputs as they operate uni-, or bi-directionally \cite{booch1996unified}\cite{specification2007omg}. Once more, sticky men are used to depict entities and their interactions with the system.

				\label{fig:uml-component-diagram-overview}
			\end{figure}	
			
			The remainder of this section first introduces an abstract high-level overview of the system architecture and components. Afterwards, further illustration present selected sub-components of our architecture.

		\subsection{Smart Contract Lifecycle Management}
			\label{ss:smart-contract-lifecycle-management}

			\textbf{Work-In-Progress}
			
			%			The lifecycle of a micro lending contract is divided into the following stages: a) preparatory, b) negotiation, c) contract execution d) rollback and e) a contract expiry stage. During the preparatory stage, information about the involved entities, such as names and addresses are incorporated into the contract. In addition, the conditions of the requested loans are formally defined by specifying, e.g, the size of the loan, chosen currency, runtime and interest rates. The conditions of the requested loan mainly depend on information available to the lender, such as financial data gathered during previous interactions and transactions, personal data and information from social media. In case the borrower and the lender agree on the negotiated conditions, both parties sign the contract and express their approval - if no agreement is reached, a contract rollback is triggered. After signing the agreement, the contract execution phase is triggered and the lender transfers the loan to the borrower as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:running-case-illustration}. Afterwards, the lender can use the loan to expand, or start a business. 
			%
			%			The micro lending contract terminates, or expires either after the defined loan timespan, or when the contract is prematurely terminated. The borrower pays back the loan either in separate rates, or as a whole, depending on the defined conditions. In addition, the lender also receives a fee, or an interest rate from the borrower for providing the loan. In case the borrower fulfills all his/her duties, the lender might provide a larger loan in the future based on the positive credit history of the borrower. Everex does not operate on the basis of P2P loans and instead invests its own aggregated capital to provide globally accessible credit services. Nevertheless, it is up to each Cryptocash owner to lend his/her own tokens to other users.
